TISM - "The Incredible State Machine"

TISM is a framework for developing tasks that can run concurrently on a Raspberry Pi Pico (or compatible microcontroller) via cooperative multitasking. The framework consists of different elements to control task scheduling, interrupt handling, interprocess messaging and software timers. The source code also includes example applications to demonstrate how the different components work, as well as a template to build your own tasks.

The source code is distributed under the GPLv3 license.
